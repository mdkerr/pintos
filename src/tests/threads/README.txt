Lab 0 - Michael Kerr

In order to add the test "alarm-mega" changes were required in the following files:
    tests.c         - the "alarm-mega" test was added to the test struct
    tests.h         - the test funciton was defined in this header
    alarm-wait.c    - the test function "test_alarm_mega" was added to this file
    
This file was added:
    alarm-mega.ck   - this will be used to see if the test passed
